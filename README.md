# Data_Viz_Final_Assignment_IBM
This is the code for my final assignment for the Data Visualization course as part of my "IBM Data Science Professional Certificate".
Analyzing US airline performance for the years 2005-2020.

My problem here is that I am getting a "syntax error" when running the file on line 81 and I can't figure out what's wrong. Also, line 81 code was not written by me, and I have left it untouched. Any help is appreciated.
